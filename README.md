This repository holds code and data of our [NAACL 2018 paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1173 ) on word emotion induction. This README file will shortly be updated and extended. 

## Introduction
Word emotion induction is the task of predicting some complex emotion score for a given word.

## Credits
Our code for word embeddings is loosely based on the [Hyperwords](https://bitbucket.org/omerlevy/hyperwords) package by [Levy et al. (2015)](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/Q15-1016/q15-1016). The original code for the boosted multi-layer perceptron approach by [Du and Zhang (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1109/IALP.2016.7875958) can be found [here](https://github.com/StevenLOL/ialp2016_Shared_Task).
